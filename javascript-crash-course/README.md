## Crash Course Overview
> This is what university or a coding bootcamp that worth over thousand of dollars are gonna teach you. In this crash course I've learnt all without paying a single dollar.
> Keep in mind, this crash course is all about execution, means the theory gonna be straight forward and no-bullshits. In order to build and output something immediately, learn by action.

### Data Types

**What are data types?**
- Data types help us recognize and organize data

**Primitive:**
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null

**Non-primitive:**
- Array
- Object

**Null & Undefined**
- Null: means nothing, the developers set this intentionally
- Undefined: means the value was never set in the first place
- NaN: not a number, if we encounter this, it means something wrong with our numbers.

### Variables

**What are variables?**
- They help us to store and access data

**How to define them?**
- var
- let
- const

    **Equality**
    "==" and "==="

    - Double equals checks values
    - Triple equals checks values & types

### Conditions

- if, if/else, if/else if/else

    **Comparison Operators**
    - == / ===
    - != / !==
    - < > / >= <=

    **Logical Operators**
    - && and ||

    - true && true => true
    - true && false => false
    - false && true => false
    - false && false => false

    - true || true => true
    - true || false => true
    - false || true => true
    - false || false => false

    **Falsy Values**
    - undefined
    - null
    - NaN
    - 0
    - ""
    - false

    **Truthy Values**
    - 10
    - 3.14
    - "Me and myself"
    - "false"
    - "0"
    - []
    - {}

    **Ternary Operators**
    - It's a shortcut for if/else statements
    - isFit ? 'Nice body' : 'More gym then'

### Loops

**What are loops used for?**
- Repeat the same logic again and over again. Also it's used for DRY - Don't repeat yourself

### Functions

**What is a function?
- It is a block of code designed to perform a specific action

### Arrays

**What are arrays?**
- Data structure that can hold multiple data values in one variable

### Objects

**What are objects in JavaScript?**
- They're used to store properties each with a pair data (key & value)

### DOM

**What is the DOM?**
- The DOM stands for Document Object Model, it allows you to tap into the elements on your websites and manipulate at your will.
